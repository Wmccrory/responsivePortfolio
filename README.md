Updating portfolio created in homework one to be responsive

responsive portfolio:
notes:
-Designing a website to be responsive during initial building seems to be easier than retrofitting an existing one. It appears that modern web design must allow a certain degree of leniency as to the appearance of a website, as opposed to the pixel perfect specifications of web design from 10 years ago.
-A good exercise in not being drawn down the rabbit hole. It's easy to become obsessed trying to perfect the look of one element for an hour or two only to break it when moving onto the next. Much more efficient to rough-in design it and sand down the edges once the basic goals are achieved.
